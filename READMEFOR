### 3. **Testing Your Setup**

Run the code again after making these changes. If you still encounter issues:

- **Check Microphone Input:**
  Use the `arecord` command to test if your microphone is capturing audio correctly:
  
  ```bash
  arecord -d 5 test.wav
  ```

  This command records a 5-second audio clip. You can play it back with:
  
  ```bash
  aplay test.wav
  ```

If the recording and playback work, your microphone is functioning correctly, and any remaining issues may be related to software configuration. If the errors persist, please let me know!
